Thank you for your interest in Stopping Point!

This mobile application allows the user to quickly see the current weather between Point A and Point B on any drive across the world.

Simply create an account, login or even continue without logging in.
Allow the application to know your location.
Enter destination and the map will reload at the destination.
Fastest route will be plotted with markers along the way.
All markers can be clicked to view current weather in that location.
RV Marker when clicked shows weather but also has button to show list of weather at all markers along the way.
